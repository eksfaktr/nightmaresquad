- Replace all shitty graphics
= Implement weight limit system (working on in new branch)
- REMEMBER, each item must have it's own inventory weight defined, but inherit from WeightItem
- Get original HUD working with SBARINFO (also a new branch)
- recreate each weapon w/ reloading (weasel will do reloading code)


// Here's an example of a melee weapon pickup. The "Fake" pickup is the
// weapon icon you see on the ground. It's actually a complicated
// CustomInventory item that, when picked up, runs through a series of
// inventory checks and finally takes action by giving and taking
// inventory items to/from the player.
